# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First, I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

#Then I determined what the average danceability was by artist and track. 
SELECT avg(danceability), artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group by artist_name
Order by track_name DESC

#Next, I determined who the top 10 artists are based on popularity.
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10
 
#After that, I determined which artist released the longest song. 
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1

#Then I determined what the average danceability was for the 10 most popular songs.
SELECT avg(danceability), track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY danceability
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

#Next, I determined what the name of the longest song was.
SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1

#After that, I determined which 5 songs have the most energy.
SELECT energy, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy DESC
LIMIT 5

#Last, I determined what the 15 loudest songs are.
SELECT track_name, loudness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY loudness DESC
LIMIT 15
